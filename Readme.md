**SATA** is a Python and GMT tool designed to automatically retrieve data from the INGV ([http://terremoti.ingv.it/](http://terremoti.ingv.it/)) online earthquakes database. It captures earthquake information and generates real-time plots. 

**SATA** works in both <u>Linux </u>and <u>Windows </u>OS. Quick guidelines are available in all pop-up windows, however, we provide a complete documentation for the tool (*Documentation.pdf*) that we strongly recommend to read. Scripts for installing GMT, python and all required modules are also available.

**<u>For Windows users</u>**: You must change the first line of *combined_plot.bat* in the *SATA_bin* folder by replacing 'PDFelement.exe' with your default pdf reader...unfortunately, it cannot read it automatically.

SATA is released under the  [MIT license](LICENSE).
